          <hr>
          <p id="description">I am a recent graduate having obtained my degree in information analytics and computer science. My passions revolve around using science and technology to improve the academic and personal spaces around me. Through a number of relevant technical skills, my pursuits have been underlined by an important question: <i> How am I making a difference? </i><br><br>I am heavily involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion spaces in and around Boulder. As an elected representative in the Leeds Student Government, I participated in and led the Reducing Student Inequities pillar group. This pillar group is best known for its accomplishments in making campus spaces more equitable for all, including the production of a qualitative study of transfer student experiences at the university. Additionally, I have been directly involved in efforts to make university applications more equitable through the elimination of standardized testing and legacy status, policies that have recently been implemented at the state level. I have also been honored as a Daniel's Ethics Scholar, working with ethics professionals around Colorado in the pursuit of a higher ethical standard in a number of professional environments. <br><br> My pursuits are supported by my technical skills. As a data aficionado, I believe in the power of information to make important change. By utilizing in-depth analytics principles and my computer science background, I have been a key contributor towards projects in a number of areas. I have experience in natural language processing, front-and-back-end web development, software development & documentation, algorithmic design, database design and analysis, operating systems & hardware, data representation, statistical representation, object-oriented programming, assembly language debugging, et cetera. <br><br> I am looking to continue my growth as an impactful member of my community through science and technology.

                <more> Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic, the northern-colorado community was hit hard. Colorado's small businesses took the brunt of this impact. The Business Research Division offers an amazing opportunity to work on customized research projects which support my immediate community. By performing analysis on the economic recovery of a community struggling to rebound, I am able to contribute to the greater regrowth effort directly while applying my analytical and technical acumen. <br><br> My projects primarily circulated around these analyses, prioritizing including data collection, analysis, and updates. Most notably, my semester's project was to create a dashboard to visualize a number of economic features and to gain a greater understanding of Colorado's restaurant landscape. By developing the tools to communicate this information, more direct action can be taken to support Colorado's restaurants as well as continue the general trend of regrowth.  </more>

                <more>Academic support is critically important to any student's experience at University. Particularly during the pandemic, CU's academic community has become significantly more difficult to navigate - students are unable to supplement their learning with personalized assistance normally available to students attending in-person courses, and it has taken a significant negative toll on the overall learning experience for many. <br><br> While working at ASAP Tutoring, I was able to help ensure the quality of tutoring for as many students as possible. As the Technology and Assessment Lead, I have undertaken a variety of responsibilities - each of which contribute to the improvement of CU's tutoring experience. My projects include weekly analysis and reporting of session data, including the quality of sessions as well as the availability of courses. Additionally, I provided semesterly reporting to CU residence life administration on metrics including exposure, efficiency, and volume as well as a detailed breakdown of student experiences. My goal is to make the academic community at CU more navigable, and my time as a tutor coordinator helped accomplish this measure. <br><br> I also facilitated tutor trainings in addition to my regular responsibilities. By helping provide sensitivity, methodological, and technical trainings to tutors, ASAP ensures that the tutoring sessions is as effective as possible. In my opinion, there is no better way to improve an academic community than to ensure efficiency, navigability, and availability. Working at ASAP has been incredibly fulfilling and I am proud of the work I have accomplished here. </more>

                <more>The slogan of the Leeds Student Government is "students enhancing the student experience". If anything describes my aspirations during my time at Leeds, this is it. LSG has given me a fantastic opportunity to create a positive impact on my community as a whole through a variety of initiatives, challenges, and collaborative projects. Even before mentioning any key projects, it is important to note that Leeds Student Government is home to many of the most remarkable individuals I have encountered at CU, and there is hardly a better organization than this one for impact and community. <br><br> Among my initiatives at LSG was the Reducing Student Inequities pillar initiative, which completed several projects with the theme of making CU a more equitable space for all students. By directly supporting legislature which supports this mission as well as performing studies on inequitable spaces, RSI worked diligently to support a variety of equity efforts in and around campus. A more detailed description of my projects and publications in this initiative can be found in the projects section. <br><br> Additionally, I was able to lead the Coding At Leeds initiative, which held programming workshops available to Leeds students with the aim of making computer-science-related skills more available to business students. <br><br> The Leeds Student Government continues to work on important initiatives throughout Leeds.

By joining a growing organization such as Whispir, I was able to be a part of a team which finding its place in the SAAS landscape. <br><br> During my time at Whispir, I completed a variety of projects relating to competitive differentiation and marketing, including providing direction using data collection and analysis. Oftentimes, these projects were done independently, giving me access to independent learning and eventual feedback which shape the type of analyst I intend to be. I helped define the partner strategy in the US market through similar means. By performing competitor and client analysis, I contributed to establishing Whispir in the communication software market. Additionally, I worked briefly to perform maintenance and evaluation of online communications, including a comprehensive evaluation of website features and a cooperative improvement process with development teams. My time at Whispir furthered to my desire to work in software. <br><br> My experience at Whispir was extremely valuable and unique, and I feel that I have a greater understanding of growth, both in an organizational and personal context as a result. </more>

By employing various linguistic principles as well as various natural language processing techniques in addition to analysis tools such as SciPy and Pandas, the application which I developed provided topic and sentiment modeling capabilities to a customer-focused team of analysts. By deploying the macro, analysts and researchers are able to derive important quantitative data from vast arrays of qualitative inputs. With additional focus on ease-of-use and a priority placed on user-experience, the tool which I developed can be easily deployed within a standard Alteryx workflow for simple additions and alterations. <br> <br> In addition to the technical responsibilities involved with development, I was able to lead a team of analysts in performing user-acceptance-testing prior to deployment. This multi-step process involved proofing the application for technical vulnerabilities and subjective UX flaws. In addition to user acceptance testing, I drafted and published relevant documentation for the tool for ease of use and a comprehensive description of its capabilities. This project was a major success and continues to be leveraged to create a more responsive customer experience today. </more>
