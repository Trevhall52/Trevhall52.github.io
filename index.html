              <p><more> The Hash Table Utilization Project is to leverage the creation of a hash table and several other data structures to solve a complex problem. My chosen problem is to create an efficient dictionary system, using several .csv files with english words and their definitions (200,000+ words total in 26 files). My project acts to improve on the already impressive efficiency of a the hash table structure by minimizing the parsing needed to find a definition. The program can be run by run by either creating one large hash table containing all english words and their definitions (large build time, short search time) or utilizing a binary search tree to access only the correct .csv file containing the searched word.
